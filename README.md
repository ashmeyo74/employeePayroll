# Employee Payroll Script

## Description
The purpose of the Employee Payroll script was to create a functioning webpage in which an employer can enter employee data (first name, last name and salary) in order to log the information to a table. This webpage calculates average employee salary, allows the employer to add as many employees as they want with the 'Add Employee' button, and picks a random employee from the listed employees.

Comments have been left to show changes done in-detail. By separating each section with comments, it allows the viewer to jump to each section in a streamlined manner. Base code was modified in order to deconstruct and better understand the process of creating functioning functions.
